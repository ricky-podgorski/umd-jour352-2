            <h1>The answer to Maryland men’s basketball's offensive struggles starts at the free throw line </h1>
            <h2>By Ricky Podgorski</h2>
            <p>It’s no question, that Maryland men’s basketball is struggling on the offensive side of the ball,
                shooting just 39.3% from field goal range, but the answer could be from the charity stripe.</p>
            <p>
                The Terps are shooting 69.1% from the free-throw line, their lowest percentage since the
                2016-2017
                season. </p>

            </script>
            <p>Although the free throw at its core is just one point, in close games they are crucial to a
                basketball team's ability to win, and for Maryland men’s basketball, the free throw is
                proving to be critical in close games.</p>

                <h2>Free throws among rotational players</h2>
                <p> Some of the biggest stars and rotational players for the Terps are shooting the worst
                    percentages from the line.</p>
                <p> Big man Julian Reese, who has struggled with free throw shooting throughout his career, is
                    shooting
                    59% from the line. That’s 10% under the team average.</p>
                <p> Reese isn’t the only player experiencing woes from the line, as transfer Jordan Geronimo is only
                    capitalizing on 66.7% of his free throw attempts. </p>
                <p>The free throw bug transcends throughout the roster, affecting not just the veterans or the
                    transfers, but the freshmen too. Freshman DeShawn Harris-Smith is shooting a staggering 53.8%
                    and Jamie Kaiser Jr. is only at 50%. </p>
                <p>No matter the position or year of the player, Maryland men’s basketball is significantly
                    struggling from the line.</p>

            <h2>Free throws matter in close losses</h2>
            <p>The free throw is overlooked throughout many basketball games but is usually associated with
                late theatrics and heroics. But free throws are a key component of point distribution throughout
                games and matter most in close ones. </p>
            <p> In Maryland’s closest losses, plenty of points were left at the line, which could be the
                game changer in a win or loss.</p>
            <p> Against Davidson, the Terps shot one of their best percentages from the line at 76.7%,
                making 16 of 21 attempts. But lost to the Wildcats 64-61, a three-point margin. Just a few more free
                throws could have been a momentum changer or helped grab a win for Maryland.</p>
            <p> In a similar outing against UAB, Maryland shot 65% from the free-throw line, only sinking 13
                of 20 free throws. The Terps lost by three, 66-63. Again, another example of how just a few extra
                free throws could determine a win or loss in close games. </p>

                <h2>Bad Percentages in the big ten</h2>
                <p>As the Terps begin their journey through Big Ten play, they currently sit in tenth place in
                    overall free throw percentage.</p>
                <p>Partnered with the worst offensive numbers in the entire conference, missing free throws
                    will lose Maryland more games in Big Ten play. </p>
                <p> Many attribute success at the free throw line to a combination of good coaching and a
                    player's mentality.</p>
                <p>On the bright side, head Coach Kevin Willard saw an increase in free throw percentage every
                    year from 2015-2022 in his former position as the head coach of the Seton Hall Pirates.</p>
                <p> Willard has experience with bringing a low free throw percentage up, but this Maryland
                    roster is a new one, with a lot of new moving pieces.</p>
                <p> And for a team that has already fallen short of high expectations, it’s going to take a lot
                    to change the mentality of a lot of these players.</p>
                <p>In a home match against Rider, Maryland recorded a season-high 103 points, getting to the
                    free throw line 45 times. Of the 45 attempts, 29 free throws were made, that’s 64.4%.</p>
                <p>Rider currently sits at 1-7 on the year, and is not comparable to Big Ten talent. The Terps will
                    almost certainly never get to the line 45 times again this season but it's crucial to capitalize
                    on however many attempts they’re granted.</p>

                <h2>looking ahead</h2>
                <p>For a team that was projected just outside the AP top 25, the offensive struggles have been
                    monumental. Until the Terps can find some rhythm from the three-point line and field goal range,
                    they’ll need to develop a stronger free throw percentage. </p>
                <p>Some games are decided by just a few points, and leaving those points at the charity stripe
                    will only bring loss after loss. For Maryland to climb from the bottom of the Big Ten to stay
                    afloat in the conference, it will have to start at the free-throw line. </p>
