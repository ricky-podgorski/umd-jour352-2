                    Jordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina
                    Tar
                    Heels.
                    As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.[5] Jordan
                    joined
                    the
                    Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick[5][13] and quickly emerged as a league star,
                    entertaining
                    crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive
                    players.[14]
                    His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk
                    Contests,
                    earned him the nicknames "Air Jordan" and "His Airness".[5][13] Jordan won his first NBA title with
                    the
                    Bulls in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat.
                    Jordan
                    abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but
                    returned to
                    the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as
                    a
                    then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.[5] He retired for the second time in
                    January
                    1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington
                    Wizards.[5][13]
                    During the course of his professional career, he was also selected to play for the United States
                    national
                    team, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament

            <div class="box">
                <p>
                    Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in the Fort Greene neighborhood of New York
                    City's Brooklyn borough on February 17, 1963,[29] to bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and
                    equipment
                    supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.[29][30] He has two older brothers, James R. Jordan Jr. and fellow
                    basketball player Larry Jordan, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named
                    Roslyn.[31][32] James Jr. became command sergeant major of the 35th Signal Brigade of the U.S.
                    Army's
                    XVIII Airborne Corps and retired in 2006.[33] In 1968, Jordan moved with his family to Wilmington,
                    North
                    Carolina.[34] He attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his
                    athletic
                    career by playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team
                    during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to
                    play
                    at that level. His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the
                    team.[35][36]
                </p>

                <p>
                    Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team and tallied some
                    40-point games.[35] The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.[36]
                    Upon
                    earning a spot on the varsity roster, he averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final
                    two
                    seasons of high school play.[37] As a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonald's
                    All-American Game and scored 30 points,[38][39] after averaging 27 ppg,[37] 12 rebounds
                    (rpg),[40][41]
                    and six assists per game (apg) for the season.[41][42][43] He was recruited by numerous college
                    basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.[44] In
                    1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where
                    he
                    majored in cultural geography.[45]

            <div class="box">
                <p>
                    As a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year
                    after he averaged 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage).[46] He made the game-winning
                    jump
                    shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival
                    Patrick
                    Ewing.[47] Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball
                    career.[48][49]
                    During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0
                    rpg
                    and 1.8 apg.[13]
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983)
                    and
                    junior (1984) seasons.[50][51] After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year
                    awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the
                    1984
                    NBA draft. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986,[52] when he graduated
                    with
                    a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography.[53] In 2002, Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary
                    men's
                    basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.[54]
